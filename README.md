## MainActivity

### Setup and Initialization 🛠️
The `onCreate` method initializes the activity, sets up the action bar, initializes the bottom navigation view, and adds the default fragment (`Calculator`) to the activity.

### Fragment Management 📱
- Fragments are managed using a `FragmentManager`.
- Fragments are stored in a `HashMap` for easy retrieval based on their class names.
- The `fragmentsExchangeStack` method sets up the logic for fragment navigation based on bottom navigation item selection.
- The `addDefaultFragment` method adds the default fragment to the activity.
- The `onBackPressed` method handles back button presses and navigates between fragments accordingly.

### App Bar Handling 📝
- The `setAppBar` method dynamically sets the app bar title based on the current fragment.

### Interface Implementation 🤝
- The `CalculateListenerInterface` is implemented to handle clicks on the "Calculate" button in the `Calculator` fragment.
- The `onCalculateClick` method is called when the "Calculate" button is clicked, and it navigates to the `TdeeMacros` fragment with the calculated TDEE result.


## Calculator Fragment
The Calculator fragment is used to calculate the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and body fat percentage of the user.

### Responsibilities
- Perform TDEE and body fat percentage calculations based on user input.
- Display input fields for age, weight, height, neck, waist, and hip measurements.
- Provide options to select gender and activity level.

### Methods
- **onAttach(Context context)**: Called when the fragment is first attached to its context. Throws a ClassCastException if the context does not implement the CalculateListenerInterface.
- **onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState)**: Called when the fragment is created. Inflates the layout for the fragment and sets up buttons and text change listeners.
- **calculateTDEEAndNotify(View view)**: Calculates the TDEE and notifies the parent activity of the result.
- **setUpComponents(View view)**: Sets up buttons and info imageviews for the Calculator fragment.
- **setUpInfoImageViews(View view)**: Sets up info imageviews for the Calculator fragment.
- **showInfoDialog(String message)**: Displays a dialog with the given message.
- **updateAge(int change)**: Updates the age displayed in the dynamicAge TextView.
- **selectGender(boolean sex, View view)**: Selects the gender in the Calculator fragment and updates the UI accordingly.
- **setUpTextChangeListeners(View view)**: Sets up text change listeners for input fields and calculates the body fat percentage based on user input.
- **getActivityFactor(View view)**: Gets the activity factor selected by the user from the Spinner.
- **onViewCreated(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState)**: Called when the fragment is created and the view is created. Sets initial values for input fields.

### Methods
- **onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState)**: Called to do the initial creation of the fragment. Inflates the layout for the fragment and initializes UI components.
- **setUpActionBar()**: Sets up the ActionBar with a custom title and back button.
- **initializeUIComponents(View view)**: Initializes UI components including TextViews, NumberPickers, and Buttons.
- **setUpTextViews(View view)**: Sets up TextViews for displaying macro titles and percentages.
- **setUpNumberPickers()**: Sets up NumberPickers for adjusting macronutrient ratios and adds listeners to update UI components.
- **setUpButtons(View view)**: Sets up buttons for modifying TDEE.
- **modifyTdee(double modifier)**: Modifies the TDEE based on the provided modifier and updates UI components accordingly.
- **getMacroPercentageForPicker(NumberPicker numberPicker)**: Retrieves the macro percentage for a given NumberPicker based on the modifier.
- **updateMacroPercentages()**: Updates the displayed macro percentages based on the selected values in NumberPickers.
- **updateNumberPickers()**: Updates the NumberPickers and TDEE when the user makes manual changes.
- **getDoubleStringLabelModifiersTreeMap()**: Retrieves intensity modifiers mapped to their corresponding modifier percentages.
- **onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item)**: Handles the back button press in the ActionBar.
- **onPause()**: Called when the fragment is no longer visible. Updates NumberPickers to avoid losing changes.
- **onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState)**: Called before the fragment's state is saved. Updates NumberPickers to preserve changes.
- **onViewStateRestored(Bundle savedInstanceState)**: Called when the view's saved state has been restored. Updates NumberPickers.
- **onStop()**: Called when the fragment is no longer interacting with the user. Resets the ActionBar to its default state.
